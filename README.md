This program is a simple banking application that manages checking and savings accounts using Java.
It utilizes ArrayList to store account information and provides functionalities such as opening accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing account details, including monthly interest for savings accounts.
The application operates through a console-based menu system, allowing users to interact with their accounts by selecting options for various banking operations.
Upon starting, the program prompts the user with options to open new checking or savings accounts, make deposits or withdrawals, print account information, calculate and display monthly interest for savings accounts, or exit the application.
Each account is identified by a unique account number starting from 1000, with checking and savings accounts managed separately.
For checking accounts, users can open a new account, deposit or withdraw funds, and view account information.
Similarly, for savings accounts, besides the basic functionalities available for checking accounts, users can also view the monthly interest earned based on the account's balance and annual interest rate.
The program ensures that operations are performed on valid accounts by checking account existence before proceeding with transactions or information display.
It uses a loop to continuously present the menu and process user selections until the exit option is chosen.
This banking application demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation and inheritance (implied through account operations and structure), and provides a practical example of managing financial transactions in software.
